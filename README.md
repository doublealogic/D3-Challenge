# D3 Challenge - Data Journalism and D3

## Background

This repository uses D3 to visualize data. The scenario is that I've just accepted a data visualization position for a fictional major metropolitan paper. This paper wanted me to analyze the current trends that are shaping people's lives as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help all readers understand our findings. 

Our editor wanted to run a series of feature stores about the health risks facing particular demographics. I would gather this data by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set that is used for this repository is derived from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. It includes data on the rates of healthcare, income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error".
