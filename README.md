# D3 Challenge - Data Journalism and D3

## Background

This respository uses D3 to visualize data. The scenario is that I've just accepted a data visualization position for a fictional major metropolitan paper. This paper wanted me to analyze the current trends that are shaping people's lives as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help all readers understand our findings.
